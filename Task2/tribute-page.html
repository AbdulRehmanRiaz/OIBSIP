		Muhammad Ali, born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. on January 17, 1942, was a legendary boxer, activist, and philanthropist. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest boxers of all time, known for his impressive speed, footwork, and powerful punches.Ali won his first Olympic gold medal at the age of 18 at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. He turned professional later that year and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming the youngest boxer to win the heavyweight title at the age of 22 in 1964, after defeating Sonny Liston.<br><br>

		In addition to his remarkable boxing career, Ali was known for his political and social activism. He was a vocal critic of the Vietnam War and refused to be drafted into the military, citing his religious beliefs and opposition to the war. This decision resulted in the revocation of his boxing license and a three-year hiatus from the sport.Ali returned to the ring in 1970 and continued to dominate his opponents, earning the nickname "The Greatest" and becoming the first three-time heavyweight champion in boxing history. He retired from boxing in 1981 with a record of 56 wins and 5 losses.<br><br>

		Throughout his life, Ali was also known for his humanitarian efforts, including his work with organizations such as UNICEF and the Muhammad Ali Parkinson Center. He passed away on June 3, 2016, at the age of 74, leaving behind a legacy as one of the most beloved and influential figures in sports history.
